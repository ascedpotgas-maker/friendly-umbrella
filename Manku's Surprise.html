  <h1>Poems For Manku</h1>
  <h2>Philippians 1:3</h2>
  <p>I thank God every time I remember you.</p>
  <p>I was thinking of you, then I thought to myself why not do something for the girl I love while I also improve my skills. HOPE YOU LIKE IT.</p>
  <h2>Yesterday, Today and Forevermore</h2>
  <p>Yesterday, I met you, and my heart skipped a beat,</p>
  <p>Today, I love you, with every step, every repeat.</p>
  <p>Forever, I'll cherish you, through laughter and through tears,</p>
  <p>With you, my love, my heart beats clearer</p>.
  
  <p>Yesterday's moments, we shared a glance,</p>
  <p>Today, our love's a beautiful dance.</p>
  <p>Forever's the promise, we'll make to stay,</p>
  <p>Together, our love will find its way</p>.

  <p>In your eyes, my heart finds a home,</p>
  <p>With you, I am never alone.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, today, and forevermore,</p>
  <p>I'll love you, my darling, forever in store</p>.

  <p>You are my sunshine, my guiding light,</p>
  <p>My love for you shines through the dark of night.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, today, and forevermore,</p>
  <p>My heart belongs to you, forever in store.</p>.
  <h2>Fair Maiden</h2>
  <p>Fairest maiden of the wire's gentle might,</p>
  <p>Whose voice, like sweetest melody, doth take flight,</p>
  <p>In whispers soft, and tones of tender light,</p>
  <p>Thou didst captivate my heart, a love so bright</p>.

  <p>In chance encounter, o'er the phone's dark stage,</p>
  <p>Our paths didst cross, and forth a spark didst engage,</p>
  <p>A flame that burns, a passion that doth not abate,</p>
  <p>For thee, my love, my heart doth consecrate</p>.

  <p>Thy laughter, music to mine ears, doth ring,</p>
  <p>A joyous peal, that doth my soul's deep spring,</p>
  <p>Thy words, a gentle breeze, that doth my heart entwine,</p>
  <p>In love's sweet snare, I am forever thine</p>.

  <p>Oh, fairest phone belle, with voice so divine,</p>
  <p>How doth my heart yearn for thee, in love's sweet shrine,</p>
  <p>To see thy face, to hold thy hand, to be,</p>
  <p>With thee, my love, in love's sweet ecstasy</p>.

  <p>Yet, till that day, when fate doth bring us near,</p>
  <p>I'll cherish every word, each tender tone, so dear,</p>
  <p>And in my heart, thy love shall forever stay,</p>
  <p>A flame that burns, a love that doth not stray.</p>.
  <h2>A Blessing From God</h2>
  <p>You are a gift from above,</p>
  <p>A blessing from God, a labor of love.</p>
  <p>Sent to bring joy to my life,</p>
  <p>A treasure to cherish, a precious wife</p>.

  <p>Your smile brightens up my day,</p>
  <p>Your laughter, a melody that never fades away.</p>
  <p>Your eyes, a window to your soul,</p>
  <p>A reflection of the love that makes me whole</p>.

  <p>You are a blessing, a precious find,</p>
  <p>A treasure to cherish, a love that's one of a kind.</p>
  <p>God sent you to me, a gift so divine,</p>
  <p>A love that's pure, a heart that's truly mine</p>.

  <p>With you by my side, I feel complete,</p>
  <p>Together we navigate life's joys and defeats.</p>
  <p>You are my partner, my friend, my guiding light,</p>
  <p>With you, everything feels just right</p>.

  <p>I'll cherish and love you, with all of my heart,</p>
  <p>Grateful for the blessing, that we never depart.</p>
  <p>You are a gift from God, a treasure so rare,</p>
  <p>Forever and always, my love for you will be there</p>.
  <h2>Proverbs 31</h2>
  <p>You are a crown to my life, a treasure so rare,</p>
  <p>A wife of noble character, beyond compare.</p>
  <p>Your hands work diligently, your feet move with care,</p>
  <p>Bringing provision to our home, with a love that's always there</p>.

  <p>Your words are wise and kind, a gentle touch that soothes my soul,</p>
  <p>You open your arms to those in need, and make our home a warm goal.</p>
  <p>You're a woman of integrity, with a heart that's pure and gold,</p>
  <p>Our family's needs are met, as you manage our home with a love that's bold</p>.

  <p>You're a woman of strength, with a spirit that doesn't fade,</p>
  <p>A woman of beauty, with a heart that's not afraid.</p>
  <p>You're my partner, my friend, my guiding light,</p>
  <p>Together we navigate life, through day and night</p>.

  <p>I praise you, my love, and celebrate your worth,</p>
  <p>You're a blessing to our family, and a treasure to our earth.</p>
  <p>You fear the Lord, and walk in His ways,</p>
  <p>A Proverbs 31 woman, shining bright in every way.</p>.
  <h2>More Than Words</h2>
  <p>More than words can say,</p>
  <p>More than any language can convey,</p>
  <p>The love I feel for you,</p>
  <p>Is deep, true, and forever new</p>.

  <p>In your eyes, my heart finds home,</p>
  <p>With you, I am never alone,</p>
  <p>Your touch ignites a burning fire,</p>
  <p>Melting fears, and soothing desire</p>.

  <p>More than words can express,</p>
  <p>The way you make my soul feel blessed,</p>
  <p>The laughter we share, the tears we've cried,</p>
  <p>The memories we've built, side by side</p>.

  <p>With every breath, I'll love you more,</p>
  <p>Through life's ups and downs, forevermore,</p>
  <p>In your arms, I find my peace,</p>
  <p>With you, my love, my heart releases</p>.

  <p>More than words can say,</p>
  <p>My love for you will find its way,</p>
  <p>Through every moment, every test,</p>
  <p>Forever and always, you'll be my best</p>.
